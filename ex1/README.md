                                     STATIC WEBSITE SERVER USING NODE.JS FOR BOOK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
AIM:
	To create a NodeJS server that serves static HTML and CSS files to the user without using Express.

ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Start the Process.
STEP 2: Inside the book-management folder, create a subfolder named public to hold frontend files like index.html and style.css.
STEP 3: In the public folder, create and write your HTML code in index.html and CSS code in style.css for designing the book management interface.
STEP 4: In the main book-management folder, create a server.js file and write the Node.js HTTP server code using built-in modules (http, fs, path)
STEP 5: Open a terminal inside the book-management folder and initialize the project using npm init -y to create a package.json file.
STEP 6: Run the server using the command node server.js to start serving your HTML and CSS files.
STEP 7: Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3001 to view the Book Management webpage served by your Node.js server.
STEP 8: Verify that the webpage loads correctly and the styles are applied properly from the style.css file.
STEP 9: Test the layout, input form, and book list table visually; make HTML or CSS updates if needed and refresh the browser.
STEP 10: Once finished, stop the server by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal and close the project.
