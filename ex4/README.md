COUNTER APPLICATION USING ANGULAR JS
AIM:
	To develop a simple counter application using AngularJS that can increment,
decrement and reset a value dynamically through user interaction.

ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Open a text editor such as Visual Studio Code and create a new HTML file.
STEP 2: Include the AngularJS library using a CDN link in the head section of the HTML file .
STEP 3: Define the root element of the AngularJS application using the ng-app directive.
STEP 4: Create a display area to show the current value of the counter using AngularJS data binding .
STEP 5: Add three buttons to perform the operations: increment, decrement and reset.
STEP 6 :Create an Angular JS module and controller using a script block inside the HTML file.
STEP 7: : Inside the controller, initialize the counter and define the three functions for incrementing, decrementing and resetting the value.
STEP 8: Click the buttons and observe the counter value updating instantly, reflecting AngularJSâ€™s real time data binding.
